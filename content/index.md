Hi, I am Minku Singh...

I am a Junior Computer Engineering student. I love building things with <b>JavaScript</b>🔨. I am a Full Stack Developer, primarily a MERN stack Developer.

When I am not coding 👩‍💻, I write real/fictional stories 🎴 , which you can find in the <a title = "Blog" href = "./blog/">blog</a> section.

I love spreading what I learn, due to which I have started writing about JavaScript in <a title = "JavaScript" href = "./javascript/">JavaScript </a>section and about Data Structures and Algorithms in <a title = "DSA" href = "./dsa/"> DSA </a>section.
