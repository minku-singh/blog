JavaScript was invented by <b>Brendan Eich</b> in September 1995 at Netscape. It was firstly named as <b>Livescript</b> but then, as JavaScript.

Every browser has embedded engine called JavaScript Virtual Machine (JVM).
The engine works as - 
1. It parses the script
2. Converts script to machine code
3. Coverted machine code runs faster

Various browsers have their own embedded JVM like - 
- V8 - Chrome, Opera & Edge
- SpiderMonkey - Mozilla
- Chakra - IE etc.

# ECMAScript
Along with JavaScript, we listen alot about ECMAScript. But what is it, really? 

ECMAScript is a language specification by ECMA International. Many languages like-JavaScript, ActionScript, Nashorn follow and implement the ECMAScript specification.

ECMAScript is meant to ensure the interoperability of web pages written in the languages following it, across different web browsers. 

ECMAScript6 (ES6) is the latest version of ECMAScript.
